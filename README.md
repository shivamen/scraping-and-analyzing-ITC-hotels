**WEB SCRAPING ITC LUXURY HOTEL DATA FROM TRIPADVISOR AND PERFORMING EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON SCRAPED DATA**

In this project I have scraped data about ITC luxury collection hotels from www.tripadvisor.in

**Tripadvisor** is a popular website to search for best hotels, restaurants, sightseeing places and almost anything for a nice trip. You can also browse through hundreds of millions of traveller reviews and opinions for a particular hotel, restaurant, tourist spot etc or look for recommendation based on other peoples experience.

ITC luxury brand includes 15 hotels across different parts of India. I have created a list of links for each individual hotel page to scrape the information

Here is an **outline** of the steps we will follow:

1. Importing libraries
2. Scrape the basic information available on website for each hotel and store it in a csv file. 
    - Hotel Name
    - Hotel Rank in that particular region
    - Hotel Address
    - Hotel Rating
    - Languages spoken
    - Hotel Style
    - Restaurants nearby
    - Attractions nearby
    - Price range
    - No of rooms    
3. Scrape the recent 1000 reviews for each hotel and store in a csv file. 
    - Review title
    - Date of stay 
    - Review text
    - Review rating   
4. Data Cleaning
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Summary of Insights
7. References
